# Installation
> Following these instructions will result in the program automatically launching with VALORANT

*NOTE: Upon downloading, your browser might mark the file as dangerous, but this is a false-positive and can be ignored (all the code is open-source)*
### Part 1: Creating a folder for the executable
1. Create a folder for the extension; this folder should be stored somewhere safe where it will not be moved
    - it is recommended to create a folder in C:\Program Files\ called "valorant-rpc"
2. Move the executable to the folder created in step 1 

NOTE: Antivirus/Windows Defender might mark the executable as a **potentially unwanted app**, this is a false-positive

**Windows Defender:** Select *Allow on device* and *Start actions* to allow the extension to run

3. Copy the path to the executable for a later step
    - if the folder was made under "C:\Program Files\valorant-rpc", the path would be "C:\Program Files\valorant-rpc\valorant-rpc.exe"
### Part 2: Changing the VALORANT launch target

1. Locate the VALORANT shortcut
    - if you typically launch from your desktop, locate the VALORANT icon
    - if you typically launch from the search bar, search for VALORANT and open the file location

2. Right click on the shortcut/icon, then select **Properties**

3. In the **Target** box, paste the path to *valorant-rpc.exe* from [part 1, step 3](https://github.com/colinhartigan/valorant-rich-presence/blob/main/README.md#part-1-creating-a-folder-for-the-executable), then select **Apply**
